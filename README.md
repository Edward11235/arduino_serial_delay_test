# arduino_serial_delay_test
The project aims to test the transmission delay of arduino serial port via USB
Delay = Transmission Time from PC to Arduino + Processing Time on Arduino

# How to use it
First, update code in "arduino_receive_and_print_timestamp" to arduino
Then, run test_serial_delay.py.
Note that you need to modify the PORT number in test_serial_delay.py if needed.

# My setup
I use windows PC with arduino Uno

# Result
Delay: 8.131265640258789 ms
